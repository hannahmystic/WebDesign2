            BAND HISTORY
        </h2>

        <p>
            <b>Cherri Cola</b> was founded by Hannah Mystic and Mary Claire McCullough in the spring of 2017 in Philadelphia. When they agreed that their dreams of jumping around on big stages and smashing the patriarchy around the world could not be quieted, they decided to turn the project into a full band. 
            They came across C.C., a 15 year old drummer measuring in at just over 5 feet tall, with the energy of a hundred caffinated chipmunks.
            Two months later they were joined by guitarist, gal pal, and internationally known eccentric Zo&euml;. 
            <br>
            Now Cherri Cola is on a journey of empowerment, energetic music, and petting lots of dogs.

            <b>Hannah</b> is an optimist, a Ravenclaw, and a strong female protagonist. Growing up in New York, she started her music career doing theater and musicals. Now she seems to throw her classical vocal training out the window by yelling in all of her songs. She enjoys puzzles, CW TV shows, multi-verse theories, and fuzzy animals.<br>Also she made this website.</p>

        <h4 id="subitem4">Drums</h4>
        <p id="p4"><b>C.C. Servon</b> has been alive for 15 years, and spent the past 7 of them drumming. She just moved to Philly from Brooklyn, where she played in several bands. She bought her first album (a 60 song Ramones compilation) when she was 5 and has been a music lover ever since. Right now, she's listening to Martha, Lou Reed, Jeff Rosenstock, the La's, and the new Screaming Females record, to name a few. When she's not playing or listening to music, she enjoys playing with her dog Friday, watching bad reality TV about tattoos, getting free stuff and magazines.</p>
